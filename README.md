# Dunno App Front-End

This is the front-end repository for the hottest, prettiest, tastiest
app ever made, Dunno App! Wanna grab some delicious Slim 'n Sass? See
how bellow!

Don't know what the hell I'm talking about? Check it out!

  * [Slim](http://slim-lang.com/)
  * [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/guide)

## Requirements

You can't make an dish without some equipment! Before diving your
fingers on those **HOT** Slim 'n Sass, you'll need to get the following
tools:

  * [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org): Follow the instructions on the
    website.
  * [RubyGems](http://rubygems.org): Follow the instructions on the
    website.
  * [Bundler](http://bundler.io): Run `gem install bundler`

We strongly recommend you to use the RVM (Ruby Version Manager) though,
as it makes the installation process simpler and it isolates the
project's environment. Just install it and you're ready! Besides, it's
**super cool**, like a pantry and a food processor all mixed up!

  * [RVM](http://rvm.io/): Run `curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable`

The project's already configured to use RVM, if present.

## Quickstart

Now that you're ready, get the ingredients and turn on the oven!

```bash
git clone git@github.com:godunno/dunno-front-end.git
cd dunno-front-end
bundle
```

While you're working on your project, run:

`guard`

Then you can start cooking *YOUR* recipe! When you're finished, just hit
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> on the terminal to kill the guard (hehe).

## See your changes

To taste the glorious piece of food you've just gave birth to, open the
file `public/index.html` on the web browser and begin the feast!

If you're starting to love the command line as much as I do, you
probably are there already and don't wanna open the file explorer.
Running `google-chrome public/index.html` will open a new tab with the
file on the active Google Chrome window! Don't you use Chrome? Any
browser works, even a hipster like Opera! Just spare a minute and search
for the correct command.

Also, do you know you can open new tabs on the terminal? On Ubuntu, hit
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>.

## Directory Structure

Don't get lost while working on those dishes, keep your table clean!

### Sass

  * `sass/*`: Sass files go in here
  * `sass/_settings.sass`: Foundation configuration settings go in here
  * `sass/app.sass`: Application styles go here

### Slim

  * `templates/*`: Slim files go in here

### Compiled files

**[WARNING]** These should **NOT** be altered in any circumstance. If
 you do, **YOU'LL CAUSE A CATASTROPHIC GLACIAL MELTDOWN AND DOOM US
ALL**. Also, a kitten will die. You've been warned.

These files are generated by processing the source Sass and Slim files.
Any changes will be overridden on the next compilation.

  * `public/*`: All compiled files go in here, the HTML on the root and
    the CSS on the `public/css` directory

## Uploading changes

Wanna share your masterpiece with some buds and make them impressed?
CHECK. IT. OUT.

  * `git add some_tasty_chips` - Add the file's changes to the commit.
    PROTIP: wanna throw the whole thing in without a second thought?
    Just run `git add .`!
  * `git commit -m "Just added pepper, now it's AWESOME"` - Send a
    message to your bros! It's a **MUST**! Seriously, you cannot commit
    without a message, I've tried.
  * `git push` - Put it on the fridge (a.k.a. Github) and wait to
    see them faces!
